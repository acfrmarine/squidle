<h2>The vision</h2>
<p>
    In recent years, ecologists and biologists have increasingly relied on digital video and image-based methods to
    examine and monitor marine habitats. These data streams are routinely collected by underwater platforms including
    Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems (BRUVS), Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), Remotely Operated Vehicles
    (ROV) and Underwater Towed Video (UTV) systems. Transforming visual data into quantitative information for science
    and policy decisions, requires substantial effort by human experts. However, there is currently no standardised
    approach for the cataloguing, annotation, classification and analysis of this imagery. Different research groups
    tend to handle the collected data in different ways, using different sampling techniques, different annotation tools
    and even referring to the same taxa by different names. This makes comparison across disparate sites difficult,
    resulting in little data re-use amongst groups. It also presents a significant barrier to asking ‘big picture’
    questions that could be answered if quantitative data was available in a consistent format in a centralized
    repository.

    Squidle is a web-based framework that aims to facilitate the
    exploration, management and annotation of marine imagery. We are working closely with
    members of the marine science community to create a streamlined, user-friendly interface that integrates
    sophisticated map-based data management tools with an advanced annotation system. Users are able to quickly select
    data using advanced queries (eg: depth, altitude, date, deployment or bounding box), which they can then subsample
    and annotate using a selection of standardised, agreed upon methods. The interface will be extended to incorporate
    machine learning tools for automated clustering and supervised classification, which will serve to streamline and
    enhance data exploration, subsetting and annotation. Data import & export tools will make it easier to import
    existing labels from commonly used annotation programs (eg CPCe), and also provide reporting tools for summaries and
    statistics. The project aims to deliver a reliable, advanced and easy-to-use web-based framework that facilitates
    direct access to survey data in an effort to reduce the latency between collecting and interpreting marine imagery.

<p>Dr. Oscar Pizarro (CI) of the University of Sydney has extensive experience in the design and deployment of underwater camera systems for photo-mapping autonomous underwater vehicles.  He has worked closely with members of the marine science community and has considerable experience working with underwater imagery and dealing with the associated technical challenges of illumination design and compensation, colour correction, data processing and machine learning. Dr. Pizarro will work closely with the prospective research associate towards developing the detailed formulation of the active learning framework and act as the interface with SeaCognition.
