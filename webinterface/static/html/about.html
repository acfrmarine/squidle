        In recent years, ecologists and biologists have increasingly relied on digital video and image-based methods to
        examine and monitor marine habitats. These data streams are routinely collected by underwater platforms including
        Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems (BRUVS), Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV), Remotely Operated Vehicles
        (ROV) and Underwater Towed Video (UTV) systems. Transforming visual data into quantitative information for science
        and policy decisions, requires substantial effort by human experts. However, there is currently no standardised
        approach for the cataloguing, annotation, classification and analysis of this imagery. Different research groups
        tend to handle the collected data in different ways, using different sampling techniques, different annotation tools
        and even referring to the same taxa by different names. This makes comparison across disparate sites difficult,
        resulting in little data re-use amongst groups. It also presents a significant barrier to asking ‘big picture’
        questions that could be answered if quantitative data was available in a consistent format in a centralized
        repository.

        Squidle is a web-based framework that aims to facilitate the exploration, management and annotation of marine imagery.
        We are working closely with
        members of the marine science community to create a streamlined, user-friendly interface that integrates
        sophisticated map-based data management tools with an advanced annotation system. Users are able to quickly select
        data using advanced queries (eg: depth, altitude, date, deployment or bounding box), which they can then subsample
        and annotate using a selection of standardised, agreed upon methods. The interface will be extended to incorporate
        machine learning tools for automated clustering and supervised classification, which will serve to streamline and
        enhance data exploration, subsetting and annotation. Data import & export tools will make it easier to import
        existing labels from commonly used annotation programs (eg CPCe), and also provide reporting tools for summaries and
        statistics. The project aims to deliver a reliable, advanced and easy-to-use web-based framework that facilitates
        direct access to survey data in an effort to reduce the latency between collecting and interpreting marine imagery.

        <p>This website is currently under development by the Marine Robotics group at the Australian Centre
        for Field Robotics.
        It is still a work in progress, and at this stage we have mainly been focussing on the
        annotation interface. The automated tools are still in the pipeline. There may still be a few bugs and todos, so any feedback and comments would
        be greatly appreciated.</p>

  <h2>Core Development Team</h2>
      <p>
    <b><a href="http://www-personal.acfr.usyd.edu.au/ariell.friedman/" target="_blank"> Ariell Friedman</a></b> is the primary architect and software developer.
    Ariell has a PhD in automated interpretation of benthic imagery and has extensive experience in machine learning, computer vision and active learning.
    He also has over a decade of experience in web development and user interface design. He has worked closely
    with members from the marine science community and has experience creating software tools and data products  that
    assist and facilitate marine science.

            <li>IMOS was established in 2007 and includes participants from all of Australia’s main university and
            government research organizations involved in marine science research. IMOS is designed to be a
            fully-integrated, national system, observing at ocean-basin and regional scales, and covering physical,
            chemical and biological variables.</li>

            <li>IMOS brings together researchers from a variety of institutions and disciplines. Represented within
            this group are benthic ecologists, geoscientists, computer scientists and engineers from multiple
            institutions who have come together by the shared understanding that a collaborative approach is
            essential for effective marine habitat monitoring at a national scale. Collaborators  include the
            Australian Centre for Field Robotics (ACFR) at Sydney University; the Institute for Marine and
            Antarctic Studies (IMAS) at the University of Tasmania; the Sydney Institute of Marine Science (SIMS)
            at the University of New South Wales; the Oceans Institute at the University of Western Australia;
            CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research; and the Australian Institute for Marine Science.</li>
