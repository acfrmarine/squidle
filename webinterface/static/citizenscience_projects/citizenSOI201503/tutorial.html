<p>
Welcome! Behind this popup window are a list of images. We need your help with tagging them!
Here is what you need to do:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click a point on the image.</li>
    <li>Click a tag from the list on the right to assign the point to a class label. Make sure you assign the label for what is directly under the point you clicked.</li>
    <li>Move to the other points within the image until they are all labeled.</li>
    <li>Once you have labeled all the points in an image, click to go to the next image.</li>
    <li>Good luck, and have fun! The more images you label, the further you progress through the ranks and the more you are helping Science!</li>
</ol>
<p>Click "Next" below to get started and to see a brief tutorial. Otherwise, if you are already a pro, simply click "Close" to continue without a tutorial.</p>
