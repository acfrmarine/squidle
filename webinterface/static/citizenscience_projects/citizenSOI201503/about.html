          The <a href="http://marine.acfr.usyd.edu.au" target="_blank">Marine Robotics Group</a> from the
            <a href="http://www.acfr.usyd.edu.au" target="_blank">Australian Centre for Field Robotics</a> is currently
            leading a research expedition in the Timor Sea (NW of Australia) at a spectacular, isolated, coral wonder known as
        Scott Reef.
            The international team are deploying multiple robotic platforms from the <a href="http://www.schmidtocean.org/story/show/3578" target="_blank">Schmidt Ocean Institute's</a>
            RV Falkor and are collecting copious amounts of photographic and oceanographic data. The collaborative
        team of engineers and scientists come from a variety of different institutions including:
          <a href="http://www.acfr.usyd.edu.au" target="_blank"> Australian Centre for Field Robotics at the University of Sydney</a>,
          <a href="http://www.whoi.edu" target="_blank">Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution</a>,

          The image data that is collected is used for many purposes including habitat mapping, monitoring biodiversity and
          change detection. In this collaborative process, the robots gather imagery and then the scientists identify
          and label the content in the pictures. This helps scientists understand what is out there and how it's
          changing through time. These labels can also be used to tell the computers what the the marked imagery
          represents, "teaching" the computers basic visual facts along the lines of: "This pattern of pixels is a
          fish," "This shape is a coral," or "This texture and color is sand, while this different looking object is
          kelp." The computer processes that "learn" these lessons are called machine learning algorithms.
          These underwater robots are producing massive amounts imagery: tens of thousands of pictures can be collected
          by a single robot in a day. It would be impossible for scientists to look at every single image and label
          every object within them. So they look at small sub-sets of imagery and label only subsets of pixels within
          the images.
          <br><br>
          These relatively few examples have been used to train computer algorithms to help label more of the data. The
          more pictures that have labeled content, the more accurate the algorithms become. <b>This is where you can come
          in and can be a huge help: Your involvement helps the robots help the scientists. By participating in this
          team, you are advancing marine science, increasing the effectiveness of these algorithms, and advancing
          human/robotic interaction. Be a part of these breakthroughs and discoveries - lend your eyes and a few click of
          your mouse to help us understand and identity more of our undersea world.</b>

  <h2>Core Development Team</h2>
        <p>This website has been developed by the Marine Robotics group at the Australian Centre
        for Field Robotics at the University of Sydney in Australia.</p>
      <p>
    <b><a href="http://www-personal.acfr.usyd.edu.au/ariell.friedman/" target="_blank"> Ariell Friedman</a></b> is the primary architect and software developer.
    Ariell has a PhD in automated interpretation of benthic imagery and has extensive experience in machine learning, computer vision and active learning.
    He also has over a decade of experience in web development and user interface design. He has worked closely
    with members from the marine science community and has experience creating software tools and data products  that
    assist and facilitate marine science.

    <b><a href="http://db.acfr.usyd.edu.au/content.php/232.html?personid=115" target="_blank">Stefan Williams</a></b>
    is the project manager.
    Stefan has had over a decade of
    experience working with autonomous underwater vehicles and currently runs the Marine Robotics group at the
    Australian Centre for Field Robotics, which operates the IMOS AUV facility. He has extensive experience conducting
    benthic surveys and with the challenges involved in working with benthic image data.
    He has worked closely with members of the marine science community and has supervised numerous postgraduate
    and postdoctoral research projects in the areas of machine learning.
